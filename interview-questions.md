# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is JSX? What is one syntax difference between HTML and JSX?
 JSX is a language that is HTML and Javascript put together, its ran in React. It allows for the user to work with both languages other than having to go back and forth between the different languages. One syntax difference is the onclick button, in JSX its onClick. 

Researched answer: JSX stands for JavasCRIPT XML,JSX is a markdown to javascript that shares a lot of similarities to HTML. The difference between HTML and JSX is the syntax of class className. HTML uses class to change the behavior of an element.

1. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified when you run the command yarn in your terminal?

Your answer: Yarn stands for "Yet another resource", its a number of files created to run a certain method. A good example is Jest and React. In Jest it allows you to test out your function. In React, yarn start allows the user to have a files to interact with the browser.

Researched answer: Yarn is a package manager that gives the user a code that serves the packages purpose. React is made up of many code dependencies, Yarn allows the structure of all the code dependecies to be organized. 

3. What is a React component?

Your answer: React component is a folder under SRC to allow the App.js to look cleaner and use other functions on multiple components. The components have to be imported from App.js to invoke that compenent. Naming the name of your component under your header also passes the component from your App.js to your browser.

Researched answer: React component consist of a type of function with JavaScript logic, these are called functional components. The goal of writing code is to have a the least ammount of code possible, by having components it allows the user to create a function that can be dynamic and prevent code from being repeated.

4. What is the difference between state values and props in React?

Your answer: State values are stored values that allow a variable to call on it later. An example would be const [myFood, setmyFood] = useState(0). Props are a way for components to pass data to each other, basically to simplify the code rather than hard coding.


Researched answer: State is a special varaible strored to control the use of how that component will behave. Components that have stored varibales are considered a logical component. useState is a react hook that allows the user to update the value and implement a method to that value. Props allow the user to pass data and behavior between components, props are invoked very similar to how a function is invoked. The difference between state values and props are the control abilities from the component. State is owned by that particular component while props are controlled externally.

5. What is the DOM?

Your answer: DOM is how a user interacts with the browser. A good example is the onClick button. The user clicks the button to interact with ther page. The DOM is the webpage that the user sees that allows for clicking or interaction.

Researched answer: The DOM stands for Document Object Model, its what the user is looking at actual visual of the code that has been writen. DOM  is the representation of HTML on the displayed webpage. The actual website is the DOM, it allows interaction from the user to the page. 

6. STRETCH: Which is the difference between a div tag and a span tag?

Your answer: Div tag basically creates a divider in the page, a block level element that will take up the whole distance from left to right. A user can either use a div tag or a an empty tag. A span tag would be to make the section bigger, by spanding out that certain section. 

Researched answer:  Div and span tags are both considered containers however both have different methods. Span tags are used for grouping small text while div's are used for larger text. The div tag is used as a divider of the webpage while the span tag is used as a inline part of the page. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Object-oriented programming: Object-oriented programming also known as OOP is a way to create containers for data that can be alterred without changing the whole program. OOP organizes around objects and classes. Its method is to structure a program into reusable code that are called classes to ctreate an object. The benefits of OOP is to simplify the strcture and make it reusable.

2. Ruby: Ruby is a programming language that focuses on simplicity. Its an Object-oriented program that uses objects, all the data types associated with Ruby are objects. The creator, Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto has been quoted to say he's been "“trying to make Ruby natural, not simple.” Ruby is percieved as a flexible langauage that allows the user to alter changes in a easier way. 

3. Implicit return: A return is usally necessary in a function or method, however in Ruby an implicit return is referred as a rteurn without putting the word "return." In Javascriopt if a return isnt in a function, the output will be undefined. For Ruby, the rteurn is the result of the last expression.

4. Ruby blocks: A Ruby block is a function that is passed to a method to decide an outcome. The keywords "do" and "end" are a way to define blocks in Ruby. Blocks are used to allow users to write flexible code. Blocks share similarities with methods except it does not belong to an object.

5. Ruby hashes: A collection of keys and their values. The values are referenced by their keys as opposed to an array that is referenced by their index of that value. The use of hashes can speed up the code in your program.
